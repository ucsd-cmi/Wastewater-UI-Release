# RTL Dashboard

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the server to see the current dashboard

```bash
npm run dev
```

Also run the storybook to see individual components

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### Development Notes

- All components should be coded with stories before actually putting it into the actual dashboard. This ensures tasks can be divided and conquered.
- It is recommended to push after each small feature(a time status/search bar)
- please rebase before actually pushing the code to resolve any potential conflicts
